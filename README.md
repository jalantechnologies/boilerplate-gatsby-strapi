# ðŸš€ Getting started with Gatsby and Strapi Boilerplate

This boilerplate helps to create easy go marketing websites, with the power of SSR we get using from Gatsby and Headless CMS provided by Strapi, which make this boilerplate perfect to use.

If you are new to both the tech then the documentation might help you to get familiar regarding both the tech-stack i.e. [Gatsby](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) and [Strapi](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html)
